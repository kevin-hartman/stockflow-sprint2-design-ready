# Design brief (StockFlow)

The PO's design intent for the StockFlow UI, the UX Designer's intake.
Recorded ahead of time so the Human Proxy can supply it in a headless
run (the same brief a human would author at the `/design` UX
interview). The UI is small (a home stock-by-location view, a SKU
detail page, an adjustment / receipt / pick form, a search), and this
brief is deliberately small.

## UI delivery

StockFlow ships as a single-page application, not server-rendered
pages. The client is a React + TypeScript app under `client/` (Vite),
talking to the backend over a JSON API; the design tokens below live in
`client/src/styles/` and are consumed as `var(--token)`. Screens are
client-side routed (home, SKU detail, the forms) with no full-page
reloads, and every state (empty, loading, success, validation error)
is a component state with a stable `data-testid` seam. The framework
choice itself is the Architect's to record (`renders_via`); this brief
states the product intent: a React SPA client plus a JSON API backend,
each tested on its own side.

## References

The design language is teased from these references; the UX Designer
extracts tokens from them and cites which decision came from which.

- **Databricks-brand default** (`client/src/styles/STYLE_GUIDE.md` and
  `theme.css`): take BRAND and COLOR from here. DM Sans typography,
  navy-900 (`#1B3139`) text, warm-oat (`#F9F7F4`) page background,
  white cards, Databricks brand red (`#FF3621`) for primary actions
  only.
- **A clean warehouse / inventory dashboard** (e.g. Cin7, Fishbowl,
  Linnworks card-and-table view): take LAYOUT and INFORMATION DENSITY
  from here. A calm, scannable table of stock-by-location on the home
  page, generous whitespace, numeric columns right-aligned with
  tabular figures, and a single narrow column for the detail page and
  the form.

## Brand constraints

- Use the Databricks brand red for the primary action / active state
  only (Receive, Pick, Save, the active link). Keep the stock table
  itself calm and high-contrast so quantities and SKUs are easy to
  scan.
- System / UI font stack from `theme.css` (DM Sans). No custom web
  font beyond what is loaded there.
- Cards are white on the warm-oat background with a soft navy-tinted
  shadow and a gentle radius. The primary button is solid brand-red
  with sharp (0px) corners. Keep these consistent across home, detail,
  and form.

## Interaction and feedback

- Every state is shown explicitly: an empty stock location shows an
  explicit empty state ("No stock at this location, receive an inbound
  shipment"), never a blank page; a SKU with no batches or serial
  detail shows a clear "not tracked", never a blank region.
- Forms never fail silently: a successful save lands on a confirmation
  view (or an inline green flash for an adjustment), and a validation
  problem (e.g. a pick that would overcommit, an unknown SKU) is shown
  inline next to the field that caused it, naming the field.
- Barcode scans are the primary input on the warehouse floor. A scan
  succeeds with a green flash and the stock row updating in place; a
  scan that fails (unknown barcode, locked SKU) flashes the scan zone
  red and shows a persistent toast.
- The home grid and the detail page are read-mostly; the
  no-silent-failure principle applies to receipt, pick, adjustment,
  and cycle-count forms.

## Accessibility

- Form inputs have visible, persistent labels (not placeholder-only).
- Tap targets on the tablet UI are at least 44x44 px.
- Quantity cells and stock-level pills use both shape and text, not
  color alone, to communicate state. An "out of stock" cell reads
  "out" AND uses the error color; a "low" cell reads "low" AND uses
  the warning color.
- Every action is keyboard-reachable and readable at 200% zoom (the
  warehouse-floor tablet defaults to large text).
- Numeric quantities use tabular figures so columns of numbers align
  visually.

## Component vocabulary

The UI is built from a small, consistent set of named components, so
every screen looks like the same product. The UX Designer records these
in `design-guide.json` `components` (each with the CSS class the pages
apply), and every feature page composes them rather than hand-rolling
markup:

- **Navbar** , navy top bar (64px) with a 2px brand-red bottom border,
  the app icon + "StockFlow" title on the left, nav links on the right.
- **Page** , warm-oat background, a centered ~960px content column, a
  `page__header` with the page title (the app icon next to the name).
- **Card** , white surface, soft navy-tinted shadow, gentle radius; the
  stock table and detail panels live in cards.
- **Buttons** , primary (solid brand-red, sharp 0px corners), secondary
  (outlined), ghost (text-only).
- **Form inputs** , persistent visible labels, a clear focus ring; a
  validation problem shows inline next to the field.
- **Stock table** , cool uppercase header row; quantity cells
  right-aligned in the mono/tabular figure font.
- **Status (stock-state) pills** , in-stock / low / out / on-order /
  quarantined, each a pill whose meaning is carried by BOTH text and
  color (never color alone).
- **Empty state** , an icon + a teaching heading + copy + a CTA (e.g.
  "No stock at this location, receive an inbound shipment").
- **Toasts** , fixed top-right; a success toast auto-dismisses, an
  error toast persists; feedback never shifts the page layout.

## Iconography and app identity

- **App icon.** StockFlow has a brand icon (a warehouse mark) shown
  next to the title, plus a favicon for the browser tab. The asset ships
  **alongside this brief**, in `assets/warehouse.png` (the same folder as
  `design-brief.md` once staged, i.e. `design/assets/warehouse.png` — NOT
  under `intake/`). The build MUST copy it to
  `client/src/assets/warehouse.png`, render it in the navbar next to the
  "StockFlow" title, and set it as the browser-tab favicon. Wiring the
  warehouse icon in is required, not optional: a shell that ships without
  the icon actually rendering (navbar image + favicon), or with a
  placeholder, has not met the brand requirement. Every screen should
  feel like one branded product.
- **Icon set.** Use a single line-style icon set consistently (e.g.
  inbound/outbound, scan, warehouse, stock-level states); do not mix
  icon styles.
- **Name + tagline.** The product is "StockFlow": warehouse operations,
  batched and barcoded, on one Postgres. Empty states and headings use
  this plain, guiding voice.
