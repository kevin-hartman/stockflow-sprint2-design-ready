# Everything below serves the built React SPA (client/dist) in production, so a
# single-process deploy (e.g. a Databricks App) serves both the API and the UI.
# It is a no-op in development (Vite serves the client and proxies /api +
# /health here, so client/dist does not exist) and a no-op for a server-rendered
# or API-only backend that has no client/. The catch-all matches every remaining
# GET path (client-side routing needs index.html on deep-link refresh), so it
# MUST stay last: register API routers above it.
