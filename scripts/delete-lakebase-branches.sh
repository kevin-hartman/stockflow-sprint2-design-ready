# Delete Lakebase branches.
#
# Substrate-only: delegates each delete to `lakebase-branch delete`
# (TS) which handles path resolution + refuses the project's default
# branch automatically. This shell keeps the orchestration pieces only:
#   - argument / .env fanout (positional names OR LAKEBASE_PR_NUM/LAKEBASE_BRANCH)
#   - additional protected-name list (main/master/staging/production)
#     for extra safety beyond the TS guard
#   - child-before-parent ordering (feature branches first, then ci-pr-*)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/delete-lakebase-branches.sh
#     Uses LAKEBASE_PR_NUM and LAKEBASE_BRANCH from .env.
#   ./scripts/delete-lakebase-branches.sh ci-pr-7 my-branch
#     Deletes those two branch names (ignores .env for names).
