# Convenient launcher for the Consort workflow.
#
# Opens a Claude Code session in the project. The orchestrator is the
# deterministic driver (consort-drive), invoked by the slash commands, not
# an LLM agent; the session just runs those commands, which spawn the role
# agents and pause at gates. Optionally seeds the first turn with a command so
# you land straight in it.
#
# Run from the project root:
#   ./scripts/consort.sh                  open a session (then type /sprint, /plan, etc.)
#   ./scripts/consort.sh sprint [name]    run the whole sprint (plan -> per feature design/build/deploy)
#   ./scripts/consort.sh plan             sprint planning only (to the plan gate)
#   ./scripts/consort.sh design <id>      design a feature
#   ./scripts/consort.sh build  <id>      build it through the TDD cycles
#   ./scripts/consort.sh deploy <id>      deploy + the working-software gate
#   ./scripts/consort.sh spike  <slug>    throwaway exploration (outside the loop)
#
# The role agents must be discoverable under .claude/agents/ (lakebase-create-project
# scaffolds them; the driver spawns them). Requires the `claude` CLI on PATH.
