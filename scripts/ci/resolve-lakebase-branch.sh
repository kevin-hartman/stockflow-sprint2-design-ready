# Resolve a Lakebase branch paired with a git branch, plus its endpoint
# and credentials, for use in CI.
#
# Substrate-only: delegates to `lakebase-ci-resolve-branch` (TS) which
# implements the full state machine (CREATED / EXISTS / VERIFIED /
# RECREATED / UNVERIFIED) and emits byte-compatible output:
#   - shell-eval form on stdout (KEY='value') for `eval $(...)`
#   - GH Actions $GITHUB_ENV heredoc form when --github-env is set
#
# Flag surface matches the legacy shell exactly so existing GH Actions
# YAML steps that consumed this script continue to work without edits.
#
# Usage / flags: see `lakebase-ci-resolve-branch --help`.
