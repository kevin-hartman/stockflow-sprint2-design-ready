# /design : feature design pipeline

Drives a feature from idea to spec to architect review to test list. This wraps the canonical consort design phases as a single one-shot you can invoke from Claude Code in a Lakebase-paired project.

## Operating contract (drive, do not narrate)

Follow `@consort/references/orchestrator-contract.md`: drive to completion via `consort-next` (enact its `primary_action`, then continue), and stop for the human ONLY at a HITL gate or a blocker. Present the decision (the `next` option titles + their `hil_prompt`s), not the CLIs you ran; report outcomes, not per-command play-by-play. Verbose step narration is opt-in (`LAKEBASE_CONSORT_VERBOSE_AGENT=1`), off by default.

## Usage

```
/design <feature-id> [--reviewer @user] [--test-strategist @user]
```

If `.consort/` does not exist in the project root, this command hard-fails with a setup hint instead of lazy-initializing: the TDD workflow has invariants (`.consort/` shape, `selection-log.md`) a lazy bootstrap cannot reconstruct. Run the project's TDD adoption bin first, or `lakebase-create-project` when starting fresh.

## Step 0 (cannot skip): claim the paired branch via the SCM workflow

**Before any design phase runs, the agent MUST claim a paired Lakebase + git branch for this feature through the SCM workflow.** This is the kit's invariant: every git branch gets a Lakebase branch, the SCM workflow state machine is its enforcement surface, and `lakebase-scm-claim-feature-branch` is the ONLY supported creation path. Skipping this step OR shelling out to `git checkout -b` directly is a contract violation and must be refused.

The bin handles precondition gating (refuses unless `.lakebase/workflow-state.json` is at `scaffold-complete` or `merged`), parent-branch resolution from the project's tier topology, the paired Lakebase + git + .env creation via `createFeaturePairedBranch` (30-day TTL), and the state-file transition to `feature-claimed` in a single call. Idempotent: re-running with the same feature-id on a `feature-claimed` row returns a no-op success.

Concretely, the agent:

1. Verifies `.lakebase/workflow-state.json` exists (run `lakebase-scm-state` to inspect). If absent, hard-fail with `SCM workflow state missing; run lakebase-create-project first.`
2. Invokes the workflow CLI with the feature id (no path/branch math required: the bin derives `feature/<slug>` and picks the parent from `tier_topology`):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/lk \
     lakebase-scm-claim-feature-branch "<feature-id>" \
       --project-dir "$PWD" \
       --json --pretty
   ```

   When `LAKEBASE_KIT_REF` is unset the npx target is the kit's main branch (the default-published-pin behavior). Setting it to a branch/tag/sha (e.g. `feip-7458-scm-state-phase-a-c`) pulls that ref, useful for smoke runs that validate an unreleased kit build.

   The bin's `--parent` flag overrides the tier-default parent when the feature must fork from somewhere else (e.g. a hotfix off production on a 2-tier project). The bin's `--instance` flag overrides the `project_id` recorded in the workflow state; usually unneeded.

3. If the bin exits non-zero, do NOT fall back to a lower-level kit primitive. Diagnose via `lakebase-scm-state --json --pretty` and surface the error message to the user. Exit codes: `1` no state file, `2` precondition refused (wrong state, invalid feature-id, already claimed for a different feature), `3` kit failure.
4. Run `.claude/commands/design.pre-hook.md` if present. The default pre-hook (shipped with the kit) documents this very step for reference; projects may APPEND project-specific gestures to it (claim a JIRA epic, post to Slack, etc.). The pre-hook does NOT replace step 0 above; it extends it.

If step 0 cannot complete, REFUSE to proceed to phase 1. Do not work around. The kit is the only path; the SCM workflow is how that path is enforced.

## Step 0.5 (cannot skip): HIL intake, a hard precondition

The design phases READ the HIL's intent from intake artifacts (`product-overview.md`, `nfrs.md`, the feature's `feature-request.md`, and `design-brief.md` for UI projects). These are not gate deliverables, they are PRECONDITIONS: `/design` MUST NOT enter phase 1 until they exist and conform. `product-overview.md` and `nfrs.md` are PROJECT-level (`.consort/`), living, and refined across features; `feature-request.md` is per-feature; `design-brief.md` is project-level under `.consort/design/`.

The per-feature `feature-request.md` is NOT authored here. It is the Product Owner's prioritized ask, authored upstream by `/plan` (sprint planning, where the Spec Author proposes the feature breakdown and the PO authors the requests for the sprint). `/design <feature-id>` only REQUIRES that feature's request to already exist and conform; if it is missing, run `/plan` first. The project-level intake (`product-overview.md` / `nfrs.md` / `design-brief.md`) is facilitated below by whoever reaches it first, `/plan` or `/design`.

**The orchestrator owns facilitating intake from the human.** Before phase 1, for each required artifact that is absent or non-conformant, the orchestrator obtains it:

- **Interactive (a human is present):** run the intake interview, draft the artifact, and present it for the HIL to review and edit. The interviews:
  1. **Product -> `.consort/product-overview.md`** (Product Owner): what the product is + who uses it; what users need to accomplish; first usable version vs later; how it grows; non-goals; what they want to see after each sprint. Open-ended product intent, no implementation detail.
  2. **NFR -> `.consort/nfrs.md`** (the Architect's intake): walk the NFR categories (performance, scalability, security, observability, operability, resilience); for each the HIL gives a hard requirement, a preference, "N/A", or "out of bounds". Write `## Required` (each item a stable `R<n>` id) / `## Preferences` / `## Out of bounds`. Every `## Required` item must later be covered by the Architect via `architecture.json` `brief_ref`.
  3. **UX -> `.consort/design/design-brief.md`** (UI projects only; skip for API / CLI / Infra): name 1-3 reference websites and, for each, what to take (brand, color, layout, tone); plus brand constraints, interaction/feedback expectations, accessibility targets. Write the required `## References` section.
- **Headless (`LAKEBASE_CONSORT_HUMAN_PROXY=1`):** there is no human to interview, so the orchestrator has the **Human Proxy supply** each missing artifact from the pre-recorded answers directory `$LAKEBASE_CONSORT_RECORDED_INTAKE_DIR` (validate-then-place; refuses a missing/non-conformant recording):

  ```bash
  ./scripts/lk consort-human-proxy supply \
    --from "$LAKEBASE_CONSORT_RECORDED_INTAKE_DIR/nfrs.md" --to ".consort/nfrs.md" --artifact nfrs.md
  ```

**UI projects:** whether this is a UI project is the persisted setting `project.uiTrack` in `consort-config.json` (set once at create via `--ui-track`, the single source). For UI projects, also facilitate `design-brief.md` (interview track 3, or Human Proxy supply headless); the precondition below reads `uiTrack` and requires the brief on its own, and the UX Designer phase then runs. For API / CLI / Infra projects (`uiTrack` false), the UX track is skipped entirely. Do NOT gate this on an env var; the config is the one way in.

**Then enforce the precondition (the hard gate):**

```bash
./scripts/lk consort-intake --feature "<feature-id>"
```

`consort-intake` exits non-zero (5) if any required intake artifact is missing or non-conformant, naming each. If it fails, **REFUSE to proceed to phase 1** and report what intake is missing. Do not work around it: the precondition is what makes intake un-skippable in both real and headless runs, exactly as Step 0's claim is un-skippable.

## How it runs: the deterministic driver

After Step 0 + Step 0.5, `/design` delegates the design lane to the deterministic
orchestrator driver. The driver sequences the per-story design pipeline and
spawns each role agent itself, run it bounded to `design`, with interactive
gates so YOU answer each per-story spec gate (headless: the Human Proxy answers):

```bash
GATES=interactive; [ "${LAKEBASE_CONSORT_HUMAN_PROXY:-}" = "1" ] && GATES=proxy
./scripts/lk \
  consort-drive --feature "<feature-id>" --only design --gates "$GATES" --project-dir "$PWD"
```

The driver:
- **Breaks the feature into stories** (Spec Author), then STREAMS each story
  through its design lane one at a time, never batching: Spec Author (ACs) ->
  Architect Reviewer (AC layers + every `## Required` NFR from `nfrs.md` carried
  into `architecture.json` via `brief_ref`) -> Test Strategist (ordered test
  list) -> that story's **per-story spec gate**. UX Designer runs between Spec
  Author and Architect for UI projects.
- **Routes deterministically** (routing is code, not an LLM orchestrator): it spawns each role as a
  subagent (`claude -p --agent <role>`, at the resolved per-role model via
  `consort-agent-model`) and emits the phase/handoff log to
  `.consort/agent-log.jsonl` as code. Tail it: `consort-log --read --feature <id> --min-level info`.
- `--only design` STOPS when every story's spec gate is approved, without
  building. The roles are `@consort/agents/{spec-author,ux-designer,architect-reviewer,test-strategist}`.

**Gates.** Interactive: at each per-story spec gate the driver stops and prints a
`GATE` marker with the pending action and the EXACT command to clear it. Surface
that story's spec to the human; on their approval record it with the human-facing
approver, naming the story (`consort-approve-gate --feature <id> --story <s>
--approver <human>`), then re-run the command to resume past it. (That is the one
human door; it routes to the same per-story pipeline gate the headless Human Proxy
approves. `--feature <id> --gate <name>` is for a feature-level gate, NOT a
per-story spec stop.) Headless
(`--gates proxy`, `LAKEBASE_CONSORT_HUMAN_PROXY=1`): the Human Proxy validates each
gate's artifacts EXIST + carry their EXPECTED ELEMENTS and approves only then. A
gate is never skipped; a missing/non-conformant artifact hard-blocks either way.

## Next

When design completes (every story's spec gate approved), the driver reports the
bounded completion. Suggest the next step to the human: **`/build <feature-id>`**
to build the designed stories. `/design` does not build, that is `/build`.

## Project post-hook

If `.claude/commands/design.post-hook.md` exists in this project, it runs after phase 3. Common uses: notify a Slack channel, assign reviewers, link the spec into a tracking doc.

The post-hook is owned by the project, not the kit: this command file only consults it when present. Author the markdown file freely; one post-hook per command (no chains in v1).

## Kit version

Pinned to: `0.3.94`

Bumping the kit may shift agent prompts. The `lakebase-update-commands` bin re-pulls canonical templates while preserving the post-hook file above.
